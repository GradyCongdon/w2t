Made from material usually destined for raw Puer production, Sunskate has a syrupy thick body with bright aromas uncommon in a black tea.\\nEach purchase is for one ~ 7 gram ball.","images":[{"key":"2021-Sunskate-Mini-Sun-Dried-Black-Tea-3_SIZEx.jpg?v=1637819999","url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2021-Sunskate-Mini-Sun-Dried-Black-Tea-3_SIZEx.jpg?v=1637819999","predictedType":"soup","probability":0.9981154203414917,"subject":"soup"},{"key":"2021-Sunskate-Mini-Sun-Dried-Black-Tea_SIZEx.jpg?v=1637819999","url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2021-Sunskate-Mini-Sun-Dried-Black-Tea_SIZEx.jpg?v=1637819999","predictedType":"wrapper","probability":0.9937231540679932,"subject":"wrapper-top"},{"key":"2021-Sunskate-Mini-Sun-Dried-Black-Tea-2_SIZEx.jpg?v=1637819999","url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2021-Sunskate-Mini-Sun-Dried-Black-Tea-2_SIZEx.jpg?v=1637819999","predictedType":"tea","probability":0.9823248386383057,"subject":"tea-top"},{"key":"2021-Sunskate-Mini-Sun-Dried-Black-Tea-4_SIZEx.jpg?v=1637819999","url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2021-Sunskate-Mini-Sun-Dried-Black-Tea-4_SIZEx.jpg?v=1637819999","predictedType":"tea","probability":0.9524461030960083,"subject":"leaf"}],"forms":[{"name":"~7g","price":1.75,"inStock":true,"grams":7,"dpg":0.25,"size":"mini","percentiles":{"size":64.81481481481481,"type":4.8076923076923075,"typeSize":83.33333333333333,"all":3.3737024221453287,"dpg":44.80968858131488}}]},{"slug":"2021-sun-fu","oSlug":"2021-sun-fu","year":2021,"style":"black","name":"Sun Fu","size":"brick","wrapper":{"type":"wrapper","src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2021-Sunfu-Fu-Brick-Tea-89_400x.jpg?v=1639139794","srcWhiteBalanced":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2021-Sunfu-Fu-Brick-Tea-89_400x.jpg?v=1639139794","alt":"2021 Sun Fu","width":400,"height":400},"bing":{"type":"tea","src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2021-Sunfu-Fu-Brick-Tea-2_400x.jpg?v=1639139794","srcWhiteBalanced":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2021-Sunfu-Fu-Brick-Tea-2_400x.jpg?v=1639139794","alt":"2021 Sun Fu","width":400,"height":400},"soup":{"type":"soup","src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2021-Sunfu-Fu-Brick-Tea-3_400x.jpg?v=1639139961","srcWhiteBalanced":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2021-Sunfu-Fu-Brick-Tea-3_400x.jpg?v=1639139961","alt":"2021 Sun Fu","width":400,"height":400},"description":"Anhua heicha fu zhuan, or fu brick, is a post fermented tea from Hunan province in China that contains \\"golden flowers\\" [eurotium cristatum].\\nAfter we fell in love with our 2018 sun fu, we commissioned a 2021 production from the very same producer.\\nA wonderful, well rounded fu brick.

A veteran Lapsang smoker spent 3 days smoking our tea, smoking at temperatures from 100C to 120C in an old style Lapsang smokehouse in Tongmuguan village.\\nThe unity of old school Fujian tea processing techniques with high quality base materials yields a totally unique smoke experience that pushes the tradition of smoked Puer tea in Yunnan (both the intentional and haphazard unintentional versions).\\nThe pine smoke character is laced through the blend with an intense nose that will settle into the base of the tea with aging, eventually transforming into a rare combination of flavors and aromas that few Puer teas can mimic.\\nAs for the tea blend, you can imagine that we wouldn\'t phone-in a blend that requires so much planning and legwork to process, suffice it to say it\'s fantastic. Burly, full bodied, deep returning sweetness, layered nuance and heavy feel.\\nObviously this tea is a natural fit for cigar lovers and Scotch whisky fanatics who want tea in the morning, but this tea is a surprise that will likely garner even fans who are wary of smoke.\\nEach cake is 200 grams.Pressed in 2020.

Our Puer all blended and ready in Yunnan, we shipped the blends to Fujian in summer. A veteran Lapsang smoker spent 3 days smoking our tea, smoking at temperatures from 100C to 120C in an old style Lapsang smokehouse in Tongmuguan village.\\nThe unity of old school Fujian tea processing techniques with high quality base materials yields a totally unique smoke experience that pushes the tradition of smoked Puer tea in Yunnan (both the recent intentional and haphazard unintentional versions).\\nThe pine smoke character is laced through the blend with an intense nose that will settle into the base of the tea with aging, eventually transforming into a rare combination of flavors and aromas that few Puer teas can mimic.\\nAs for the tea blend, you can imagine that we wouldn\'t phone-in a blend that requires so much planning and legwork to process, suffice it to say it\'s fantastic. Burly, full bodied, deep returning sweetness, layered nuance and heavy feel.\\nObviously this tea is a natural fit for cigar lovers and Scotch whisky fanatics who want tea in the morning, but this tea is a surprise that will likely garner even fans who are wary of smoke as well.\\nThis is the mini version and each mini is ~7g.\\nFor aging, we recommend that smoked teas be sealed and separated from other teas, as the fresh smoke will pass along to the teas next to it.

Will age beautifully in the long term, or drink now and go to space, kitties.Each cake is 200 grams.","images":[{"key":"2020-Astro-Kittens-2_SIZEx.jpg?v=1591621866","url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2020-Astro-Kittens-2_SIZEx.jpg?v=1591621866","predictedType":"tea","probability":0.9998913407325745,"subject":"tea-top"},{"key":"2020-Astro-Kittens-3_SIZEx.jpg?v=1591621866","url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2020-Astro-Kittens-3_SIZEx.jpg?v=1591621866","predictedType":"tea","probability":0.9997730851173401,"subject":"tea-bottom"},{"key":"2020-Astro-Kittens-4_SIZEx.jpg?v=1591621867","url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2020-Astro-Kittens-4_SIZEx.jpg?v=1591621867","predictedType":"soup","probability":0.9981973171234131,"subject":"soup"},{"key":"2020-Astro-Kittens_SIZEx.jpg?v=1591621865","url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2020-Astro-Kittens_SIZEx.jpg?v=1591621865","predictedType":"wrapper","probability":0.842140257358551,"subject":"wrapper-top"},{"key":"2020-Astro-Kittens-5_SIZEx.jpg?v=1591621867","url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2020-Astro-Kittens-5_SIZEx.jpg?v=1591621867","predictedType":"tea","probability":0.5669074058532715,"subject":"leaf"}],"forms":[{"name":"200g","price":148,"inStock":true,"grams":200,"dpg":0.74,"size":"cake","percentiles":{"size":84.59915611814345,"type":86.15107913669065,"typeSize":74.40944881889764,"all":92.47404844290658,"dpg":84.42906574394463}},{"name":"25g","price":21.5,"inStock":true,"grams":25,"dpg":0.86,"size":"sample","percentiles":{"size":85.23622047244095,"type":37.94964028776978,"typeSize":71.84873949579831,"all":48.6159169550173,"dpg":88.14878892733564}}]},{"slug":"2019-ztmdkz","oSlug":"2019-ztmdkz","year":2019,"style":"ripe","name":"ZTMDKZ","size":"cake","wrapper":{"type":"wrapper","src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2019-ZTMDKZ-2_400x.jpg?v=1580936681","srcWhiteBalanced":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2019-ZTMDKZ-2_400x.jpg?v=1580936681","alt":"2019 ZTMDKZ","width":400,"height":400},"bing":{"type":"tea","src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2019-ZTMDKZ-2_400x.jpg?v=1580936681","srcWhiteBalanced":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2019-ZTMDKZ-2_400x.jpg?v=1580936681","alt":"2019 ZTMDKZ","width":400,"height":400},"soup":{"type":"soup","src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2019-ZTMDKZ-2_400x.jpg?v=1580936681","srcWhiteBalanced":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2019-ZTMDKZ-2_400x.jpg?v=1580936681","alt":"2019 ZTMDKZ","width":400,"height":400},"description":"What would happen if you took a blend of high quality small batch shu material and aged Xinhui Mandarin orange peels, then roasted it all in fresh fragrant bamboo?

This production was made entirely of old arbor tea that is usually destined to be raw Puer tea. If you are accustomed to drinking yueguangbai teas with a bud heavy picking standard, you may notice that this tea has a lot of larger leaves; this is because when you make an old arbor tea you want to pick whatever the trees are giving and not waste a bit of it. The bamboo processing of this tea means that the leaves are broken up, so the tea will brew faster and stronger due to the increased surface area.This tea has a thick enduring aroma and flavor with a hefty, silky body. The base character of the tea has been wonderfully integrated with the roasted flavors and sweet aroma of the bamboo.Each piece of bamboo was pressed with 200 grams of tea.

This production was made entirely of old arbor tea that is usually destined to be raw Puer tea. If you are accustomed to drinking yueguangbai teas with a bud heavy picking standard, you may notice that this tea has a lot of larger leaves; this is because when you make an old arbor tea you want to pick whatever the trees are giving and not waste a bit of it.This tea has a thick enduring aroma and flavor with a hefty, silky body. A beautiful cake that any lover of white teas must try.Each cake is 200 grams.Pressed in 2019. Each cake is 200g. The cakes are in bamboo tongs, with five cakes per tong.

In this case, the term maocha refers to the Dancong oolong tea being left in its raw form before pressing. We commissioned this production to be left with stems and large leaves for this pressing. The roast is medium-heavy, roasted for 24 hours with the highest temperature at 125 C. The heavier roast will evolve and calm in the coming years, despite having a slight bite at the time of pressing.The brick is incredibly fragrant, with deeper honey and floral flavors emerging throughout the course of a session. This tea is still slightly punchy, but the tea has a complex interplay between the roast and the brighter aspects of a traditional Milan Dancong. Excellent endurance, this tea can be re-steeped for a very long time. Drink now or age as you please.Each brick is 200 grams.

The tea has excellent endurance and can steep for a very long time and can even withstand being simmered or boiled without becoming acrid.Both the white tea and black tea have been sun dried and should age well together. However, we are only two three years deep on this experiment; though the results are promising, how it will age in the long term is anybody\'s guess.

It is our white2tea twist on the classic concept strong style of \\"builder\'s tea\\" from the UK.

In this case, the term maocha refers to the Dancong oolong tea being left in its raw form before pressing. We commissioned this production to be left with stems and large leaves for this pressing. The roast is also medium-heavy, roasted for 24 hours with the highest temperature at 125 C. We wanted a heavier roast that could evolve and calm in the coming years, despite having a slight bite at the time of pressing.The brick is incredibly fragrant, with deeper honey and floral flavors emerging throughout the course of a session. This tea is still slightly punchy, but the tea has a complex interplay between the roast and the brighter aspects of a traditional Milan Dancong. Drink now or age as you please.Each brick is 200 grams. Each tong is a bamboo leaf packed with two bricks.Pressed in 2018 using Milan Dancong maocha [in this case, referring to the unsorted tea directly after processing.

Drink now or age if you can keep your hands off this puppy.Each cake is 200 grams.","images":[{"key":"2018-Lucky-Puppy-Puer-Tea-2-1_SIZEx.jpg?v=1580922493","url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2018-Lucky-Puppy-Puer-Tea-2-1_SIZEx.jpg?v=1580922493","predictedType":"tea","probability":0.9999284744262695,"subject":"tea-top"},{"key":"2018-Lucky-Puppy-Puer-Tea-4-1_SIZEx.jpg?v=1580922493","url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2018-Lucky-Puppy-Puer-Tea-4-1_SIZEx.jpg?v=1580922493","predictedType":"tea","probability":0.9997978806495667,"subject":"tea-bottom"},{"key":"2018-Lucky-Puppy-Puer-Tea_SIZEx.jpg?v=1580922493","url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2018-Lucky-Puppy-Puer-Tea_SIZEx.jpg?v=1580922493","predictedType":"wrapper","probability":0.9997730851173401,"subject":"wrapper-top"},{"key":"2018-Lucky-Puppy-Puer-Tea-5_SIZEx.jpg?v=1580922493","url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2018-Lucky-Puppy-Puer-Tea-5_SIZEx.jpg?v=1580922493","predictedType":"soup","probability":0.9993450045585632,"subject":"soup"},{"key":"2018-Lucky-Puppy-Puer-Tea-3_SIZEx.jpg?v=1580922493","url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2018-Lucky-Puppy-Puer-Tea-3_SIZEx.jpg?v=1580922493","predictedType":"underside","probability":0.9806540608406067,"subject":"wrapper-bottom"},{"key":"2018-Lucky-Puppy-Puer-Tea-6-1_SIZEx.jpg?v=1580922496","url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2018-Lucky-Puppy-Puer-Tea-6-1_SIZEx.jpg?v=1580922496","predictedType":"leaf","probability":0.6526792049407959,"subject":"leaf"}],"forms":[{"name":"200g","price":268,"inStock":true,"grams":200,"dpg":1.34,"size":"cake","percentiles":{"size":96.83544303797468,"type":95.86330935251799,"typeSize":94.09448818897638,"all":97.83737024221453,"dpg":95.58823529411765}},{"name":"25g","price":38.5,"inStock":true,"grams":25,"dpg":1.54,"size":"sample","percentiles":{"size":97.24409448818898,"type":55.75539568345324,"typeSize":94.11764705882354,"all":66.86851211072664,"dpg":97.75086505190312}}]},{"slug":"2018-hot-brandy","oSlug":"2018-hot-brandy","year":2018,"style":"black","name":"Hot Brandy","size":"cake","wrapper":{"type":"wrapper","src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2018-Hot-Brandy-tea1_400x.jpg?v=1580922129","srcWhiteBalanced":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2018-Hot-Brandy-tea1_400x.jpg?v=1580922129","alt":"2018 Hot Brandy","width":400,"height":400},"bing":{"type":"tea","src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2018-Hot-Brandy-tea-31_400x.jpg?v=1580922129","srcWhiteBalanced":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2018-Hot-Brandy-tea-31_400x.jpg?v=1580922129","alt":"2018 Hot Brandy","width":400,"height":400},"soup":{"type":"soup","src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2018-Hot-Brandy-tea-42_400x.jpg?v=1580922132","srcWhiteBalanced":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2018-Hot-Brandy-tea-42_400x.jpg?v=1580922132","alt":"2018 Hot Brandy","width":400,"height":400},"description":"A blend of both white and black tea experiment gone horribly right, this is the latest incarnation of our sold out 2016 Hot Brandy.

We tried and fell in love with this tea in 2017, but were too late to buy any of the material. In the spring of 2018 we had our money in the producers hands before the buds were plucked.Censers is an elegant white tea with a full bodied smoothness. The tea has a bright and complex fragrance that endures throughout a long session, lingering in the mouth and the cups long after the tea has gone.

The sister brick is material processed with a shorter kill green phase at a lower temperature, where as the brother brick is processed with a higher flame and fried for a longer time. These are their natural processing styles as people, I simply told them to process the tea as they normally would and to keep their respective materials separate for pressing.This set is best used in a side by side comparison to see how the person processing a tea can influence the end results of identical material. It should shed light on how much variation can truly occur, not only within a \\"single origin\\" tea, but even within a family using identical material from a single tea garden.Each set is 200 grams of raw Puer tea, comprised of two 100g bricks. Though this is an educational set, the tea is pretty damn nice - learning should be fun.The Sister Brother set includes two separate 100g Raw Puer bricks pressed in 2016.

The per gram price and cake price of this tea are identical to facilitate people buying less than a full cake with no mark up.","images":[{"key":"2016-LastThoughts-Tea-3_SIZEx.jpg?v=1580908461","url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2016-LastThoughts-Tea-3_SIZEx.jpg?v=1580908461","predictedType":"tea","probability":0.9992116689682007,"subject":"tea-bottom"},{"key":"2016-LastThoughts-Tea-2_SIZEx.jpg?v=1580908461","url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2016-LastThoughts-Tea-2_SIZEx.jpg?v=1580908461","predictedType":"soup","probability":0.9973694682121277,"subject":"soup"},{"key":"2016-LastThoughts-Tea-4_SIZEx.jpg?v=1580908461","url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2016-LastThoughts-Tea-4_SIZEx.jpg?v=1580908461","predictedType":"tea","probability":0.9963151216506958,"subject":"tea-top"},{"key":"2016-LastThoughts-Tea_SIZEx.jpg?v=1581314759","url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2016-LastThoughts-Tea_SIZEx.jpg?v=1581314759","predictedType":"wrapper","probability":0.9906517267227173,"subject":"wrapper-top"},{"key":"2016-LastThoughts-Tea-5_SIZEx.jpg?v=1580908461","url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2016-LastThoughts-Tea-5_SIZEx.jpg?v=1580908461","predictedType":"leaf","probability":0.9725136756896973,"subject":"leaf"},{"key":"2016-LastThoughts-Tea-6_SIZEx.jpg?v=1580908465","url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2016-LastThoughts-Tea-6_SIZEx.jpg?v=1580908465","predictedType":"underside","probability":0.6494511365890503,"subject":"wrapper-bottom"}],"forms":[{"name":"357g","price":568,"inStock":true,"grams":357,"dpg":1.5910364145658262,"size":"cake","percentiles":{"size":95,"type":99.82014388489209,"typeSize":95,"all":99.91349480968859,"dpg":98.1833910034602}},{"name":"25g","price":40,"inStock":true,"grams":25,"dpg":1.6,"size":"sample","percentiles":{"size":98.22834645669292,"type":57.55395683453237,"typeSize":96.21848739495799,"all":68.68512110726644,"dpg":98.35640138408304}}]},{"slug":"2016-nightlife","oSlug":"2016-nightlife","year":2016,"style":"unknown","name":"Nightlife","size":"sample","wrapper":{"type":"wrapper","src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2016-nightlife-moonlight-white-tea-1_400x.jpg?v=1580908677","srcWhiteBalanced":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2016-nightlife-moonlight-white-tea-1_400x.jpg?v=1580908677","alt":"2016 Nightlife","width":400,"height":400},"bing":{"type":"tea","src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2016-nightlife-moonlight-white-tea-3_400x.jpg?v=1580908677","srcWhiteBalanced":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2016-nightlife-moonlight-white-tea-3_400x.jpg?v=1580908677","alt":"2016 Nightlife","width":400,"height":400},"soup":{"type":"soup","src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2016-nightlife-moonlight-white-tea-5_400x.jpg?v=1580908677","srcWhiteBalanced":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2016-nightlife-moonlight-white-tea-5_400x.jpg?v=1580908677","alt":"2016 Nightlife","width":400,"height":400},"description":"Nightlife is a bud heavy, high grade production of yueguangbai [moonlight white] style Puer tea, commissioned from large leaf varietal material usually destined for raw Puer tea.The tea has a heavy, creamy mouth feel with an airy sweetness and aroma.
