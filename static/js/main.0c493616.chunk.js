This bud heavy whole leaf Yunnan sun dried tea was mercilessly crammed into bamboo and hand roasted over an open flame.The result is a shard heavy tea with many of broken bits and plenty of surface area which cause the tea to steep out very quickly making a very potent brew for an afternoon pick me up or a morning eye opener. This tea is very versatile with a heavy aroma of fragrant bamboo, malt and honey; not to mention a booming lingering aftertaste. Steep in gongfu style like a bamboo loving connoisseur or western style topped off with cream like you have a job to do.The mash up of style and function makes this unique tea a common morning cup in the white2tea house.Each piece of bamboo was pressed with 200 grams of tea.","images":{"leaf":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2021-Builders-Bamboo-Roasted-Black-Tea-5_SIZEx.jpg?v=1637820135","wrapperTop":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2021-Builders-Bamboo-Roasted-Black-Tea_SIZEx.jpg?v=1637820135","teaTop":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2021-Builders-Bamboo-Roasted-Black-Tea-2_SIZEx.jpg?v=1637820135","soup":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2021-Builders-Bamboo-Roasted-Black-Tea-4_SIZEx.jpg?v=1637820135","teaDetail":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2021-Builders-Bamboo-Roasted-Black-Tea-3_SIZEx.jpg?v=1637820135"},"forms":[{"name":"200g","price":49,"inStock":true,"grams":200,"dpg":0.245,"size":"cake","percentiles":{"size":43.037974683544306,"type":80.76923076923077,"typeSize":56.52173913043478,"all":72.14532871972318,"dpg":43.5121107266436}},{"name":"25g","price":7.5,"inStock":true,"grams":25,"dpg":0.3,"size":"sample","percentiles":{"size":45.47244094488189,"type":32.69230769230769,"typeSize":58.333333333333336,"all":25.60553633217993,"dpg":51.64359861591696}}],"url":"https://white2tea.com/products/2021-builders","tags":["Black Tea"],"quantity":970,"thumbnailUrl":"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2021-Builders-Bamboo-Roasted-Black-Tea.jpg?v=1637820135","version":"1.0"},{"slug":"2021-beebe","year":2021,"style":"white","name":"Beebe","size":"cake","description":"Our 2021 Beebe is a sun dried white tea from Yunnan, made from camellia sinensis assamica (large leaf varietal) leaves from old trees, usually destined for raw Puer production.\\nA white tea with rich candy sweetness, bright clarity in the mouth and sugar cane aromas locked in the soup that linger long after the tea is gone. \\nEach cake is 200 grams, with 5 cakes per bamboo tong.","images":{"wrapperTop":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2021-Beebe-Yunnan-white-Tea_SIZEx.jpg?v=1637819711","leaf":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2021-Beebe-Yunnan-white-Tea-5_SIZEx.jpg?v=1637819590","soup":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2021-Beebe-Yunnan-white-Tea-4_SIZEx.jpg?v=1637819590","teaBottom":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2021-Beebe-Yunnan-white-Tea-3_SIZEx.jpg?v=1637819711","teaTop":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2021-Beebe-Yunnan-white-Tea-2_SIZEx.jpg?v=1637819711"},"forms":[{"name":"200g","price":65,"inStock":true,"grams":200,"dpg":0.325,"size":"cake","percentiles":{"size":51.89873417721519,"type":80.85106382978724,"typeSize":54.285714285714285,"all":77.33564013840831,"dpg":54.844290657439444}},{"name":"25g","price":9.75,"inStock":true,"grams":25,"dpg":0.39,"size":"sample","percentiles":{"size":55.511811023622045,"type":35.638297872340424,"typeSize":60.714285714285715,"all":30.622837370242216,"dpg":63.062283737024224}}],"url":"https://white2tea.com/products/2021-beebe","tags":["White Tea"],"quantity":126,"thumbnailUrl":"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0313/6064/7305/products/2021-Beebe-Yunnan-white-Tea.jpg?v=1637819711","version":"1.0"},{"slug":"2021-bosch","year":2021,"style":"raw","name":"Bosch","size":"cake","description":"The return of our classic blend for the old heads.

The bamboo processing of this tea means that the leaves are broken up, so the tea will brew faster and stronger due to the increased surface area.This tea has a thick enduring aroma and flavor with a hefty, silky body. The base character of the tea has been wonderfully integrated with the roasted flavors and sweet aroma of the bamboo.Each piece of bamboo was pressed with 200 grams of tea.

The heavier roast will evolve and calm in the coming years, despite having a slight bite at the time of pressing.The brick is incredibly fragrant, with deeper honey and floral flavors emerging throughout the course of a session.

In this case, the term maocha refers to the Dancong oolong tea being left in its raw form before pressing. We commissioned this production to be left with stems and large leaves for this pressing. The roast is also medium-heavy, roasted for 24 hours with the highest temperature at 125 C. We wanted a heavier roast that could evolve and calm in the coming years, despite having a slight bite at the time of pressing.The brick is incredibly fragrant, with deeper honey and floral flavors emerging throughout the course of a session. This tea is still slightly punchy, but the tea has a complex interplay between the roast and the brighter aspects of a traditional Milan Dancong. Drink now or age as you please.Each brick is 200 grams. Each tong is a bamboo leaf packed with two bricks.Pressed in 2018 using Milan Dancong maocha [in this case, referring to the unsorted tea directly after processing.
