This just missed the release with our other 2020 Spring teas, so we are releasing it later than usual. <br></p>\n<p>This tea is more of a personal production; a few kilograms of scraped together astronomically priced Yiwu. I wouldn't really recommend this tea for people who are new to drinking raw Puer. (under several years or so) The reasons this tea is phenomenal are not \"slap in the face obvious\", but it is unbelievably comforting to drink, like sweet silk covering your throat and stomach. Drink this tea if you are deep into Yiwu and have the budget, otherwise pretend you never saw this and buy the <a href=\"https://white2tea.com/collections/2020-raw-puer-tea/products/2020-inb4\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"2020 inb4 Puer tea\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2020 inb4</a> instead.

Even fewer people yet bother taking high end raw Puer and fermenting at very light levels which are riskier and more difficult to control. Even fewer people than that make multiple small batches of high end, deftly fermented materials and then blend them together.<br></span></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;\">Lucky for you, we are not most people. </span></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;\">The Nameless One blends several high end materials from several regions at several different levels of fermentation. The result is syrupy thickness, mouth watering <em>huigan</em>, and a complex and engaging steep to steep experience that will make you question the genre. This tea was blended to age, but it's entrancing now. </span></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;\">This is the culmination of five years of intense observation of the pile fermenting process in Menghai.

    "description": "The 2020 Milan Maocha is a bit of a misnomer, how can a tea be both <em>maocha</em> [loose tea] and a brick? In this case, the term <em>maocha</em> refers to the Dancong oolong tea being left in its raw form before pressing. We commissioned this production to be left with stems and large leaves for this pressing. The roast is medium-heavy, roasted for 24 hours with the highest temperature at 125 C. The heavier roast will evolve and calm in the coming years, despite having a slight bite at the time of pressing.<br><br>The brick is incredibly fragrant, with deeper honey and floral flavors emerging throughout the course of a session. This tea is still slightly punchy, but the tea has a complex interplay between the roast and the brighter aspects of a traditional Milan Dancong. Excellent endurance, this tea can be re-steeped for a very long time. Drink now or age as you please.<br><br>Each brick is 200 grams. <br>",

Floral and honey-like in its flavors and aromas, it's quite a unique white tea experience.</p>\n<p><br> Pressed in 2020, Each cake is 200g. A tong is a stack of five cakes.<br></p>",

    "description": "The 2019 Milan Maocha is a bit of a misnomer, how can a tea be both <em>maocha</em> [loose tea] and a brick? In this case, the term <em>maocha</em> refers to the Dancong oolong tea being left in its raw form before pressing. We commissioned this production to be left with stems and large leaves for this pressing. The roast is medium-heavy, roasted for 24 hours with the highest temperature at 125 C. The heavier roast will evolve and calm in the coming years, despite having a slight bite at the time of pressing.<br><br>The brick is incredibly fragrant, with deeper honey and floral flavors emerging throughout the course of a session. This tea is still slightly punchy, but the tea has a complex interplay between the roast and the brighter aspects of a traditional Milan Dancong. Excellent endurance, this tea can be re-steeped for a very long time. Drink now or age as you please.<br><br>Each brick is 200 grams. Each tong is a bamboo leaf packed with two bricks.<br>Pressed in 2019 using Milan Dancong <em>maocha</em> [in this case, referring to the unsorted tea directly after processing. This tea includes stems and larger leaves].  Each brick is 200g. Bricks are packed in bamboo leaves, with two bricks in a tong.",

It is our white2tea twist on the classic concept strong style of \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder%27s_tea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">builder's tea</a>\" from the UK. This bud heavy whole leaf Yunnan sun dried tea was mercilessly crammed into bamboo and hand roasted over an open flame.<br><br>The result is a shard heavy tea with many of broken bits and plenty of surface area which cause the tea to steep out very quickly making a very potent brew for an afternoon pick me up or a morning eye opener. This tea is very versatile with a heavy aroma of fragrant bamboo, malt and honey; not to mention a booming lingering aftertaste. Steep in gongfu style like a bamboo loving connoisseur or western style topped off with cream like you have a job to do.<br><br>The mash up of style and function makes this unique tea a common morning cup in the white2tea house.<br><br>Each piece of bamboo was pressed with 200 grams of tea.<br>",

The provinces of Fujian, Yunnan, and Guizhou are all present in the blend. The broad range of materials unite together to form a layered experience of smooth, fragrant sweetness. The Tripel has a complex floral base and creamy texture in the mouth. The flavors evolve from steep to steep as different materials contribute their character. We prefer this tea brewed gongfu style, but it also does well grandpa style or even simmered.</div>\n<br>\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"short-description\">We hope you have the opportunity to try this unique blend of tea.

    "description": "The 2018 Milan Maocha is a bit of a misnomer, how can a tea be both <em>maocha</em> [loose tea] and a brick? In this case, the term <em>maocha</em> refers to the Dancong oolong tea being left in its raw form before pressing. We commissioned this production to be left with stems and large leaves for this pressing. The roast is also medium-heavy, roasted for 24 hours with the highest temperature at 125 C. We wanted a heavier roast that could evolve and calm in the coming years, despite having a slight bite at the time of pressing.<br><br>The brick is incredibly fragrant, with deeper honey and floral flavors emerging throughout the course of a session. This tea is still slightly punchy, but the tea has a complex interplay between the roast and the brighter aspects of a traditional Milan Dancong.

Lucky Puppy evolves from steep to steep in a gongfu brewing session, displaying a wide array of characteristics and a unique experience. The tea has a powerful aggressive character in earlier steeps, with a lasting huigan and depth of returning flavor. The later steeps trail off into smooth sweetness and can be resteeped many times. Drink now or age if you can keep your hands off this puppy.<br><br>Each cake is 200 grams.<br><br>",

The black star has a woody character, and much of the strong young fruit has faded, as the flavors have moved towards medicinal flavor. For those interested in a stronger fruity flavor, we recommend the 2015 Red Star.<br><br>Most of the cost of this tea is due to the high price of both the handmade labor and the prized skins of Xinhui Mandarins, which cost much more than most Puer tea by weight.
