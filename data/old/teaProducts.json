    "description": "<p>Liubao <em>heicha</em>, also known as dark tea, a post fermented tea from Guangxi province in China. <br></p>\n<p>This tea was made on commission for white2tea in autumn of 2021.<br></p>\n<p>Not the typical mass produced and pile fermented dark liubao. Raw may be a misnomer, but calling it green doesn’t quite seem right either, and some folk have even suggested this tea qualify as a yellow tea or some hybrid unfermented heicha. In China people often call it <em>nongjia</em> or farmer style, though it is rarely sold on the open market due to small production sizes and lack of proper accreditation. You will find similarities in this tea that spans genres – green tea, yellow tea, heicha, raw Puer – there is a reason you can’t pin it down easily. </p>\n<p>Lively aromas with a sticky sweetness and refreshing taste. Lovely to drink now or age as you desire.</p>\n<p>Each basket contains ~250g of tea.<br></p>"

This just missed the release with our other 2020 Spring teas, so we are releasing it later than usual. <br></p>\n<p>This tea is more of a personal production; a few kilograms of scraped together astronomically priced Yiwu. I wouldn't really recommend this tea for people who are new to drinking raw Puer. (under several years or so) The reasons this tea is phenomenal are not \"slap in the face obvious\", but it is unbelievably comforting to drink, like sweet silk covering your throat and stomach. Drink this tea if you are deep into Yiwu and have the budget, otherwise pretend you never saw this and buy the <a href=\"https://white2tea.com/collections/2020-raw-puer-tea/products/2020-inb4\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"2020 inb4 Puer tea\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2020 inb4</a> instead.

    "description": "The 2020 Milan Maocha is a bit of a misnomer, how can a tea be both <em>maocha</em> [loose tea] and a brick? In this case, the term <em>maocha</em> refers to the Dancong oolong tea being left in its raw form before pressing. We commissioned this production to be left with stems and large leaves for this pressing. The roast is medium-heavy, roasted for 24 hours with the highest temperature at 125 C. The heavier roast will evolve and calm in the coming years, despite having a slight bite at the time of pressing.<br><br>The brick is incredibly fragrant, with deeper honey and floral flavors emerging throughout the course of a session. This tea is still slightly punchy, but the tea has a complex interplay between the roast and the brighter aspects of a traditional Milan Dancong. Excellent endurance, this tea can be re-steeped for a very long time. Drink now or age as you please.<br><br>Each brick is 200 grams. <br>"

Floral and honey-like in its flavors and aromas, it's quite a unique white tea experience.</p>\n<p><br> Pressed in 2020, Each cake is 200g. A tong is a stack of five cakes.<br></p>"

In this case, the term <em>maocha</em> refers to the Dancong oolong tea being left in its raw form before pressing. We commissioned this production to be left with stems and large leaves for this pressing. The roast is medium-heavy, roasted for 24 hours with the highest temperature at 125 C. The heavier roast will evolve and calm in the coming years, despite having a slight bite at the time of pressing.<br><br>The brick is incredibly fragrant, with deeper honey and floral flavors emerging throughout the course of a session. This tea is still slightly punchy, but the tea has a complex interplay between the roast and the brighter aspects of a traditional Milan Dancong. Excellent endurance, this tea can be re-steeped for a very long time. Drink now or age as you please.<br><br>Each brick is 200 grams. Each tong is a bamboo leaf packed with two bricks.<br>Pressed in 2019 using Milan Dancong <em>maocha</em> [in this case, referring to the unsorted tea directly after processing. This tea includes stems and larger leaves].  Each brick is 200g. Bricks are packed in bamboo leaves, with two bricks in a tong."

    "description": "A <a href=\"https://white2tea.com/2015/11/24/what-is-traditional-bamboo-puer-processing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hand roasted bamboo</a> black tea, the 2019 Builders is a perfect balance of working class utility and artisan tea snobbery. It is our white2tea twist on the classic concept strong style of \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder%27s_tea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">builder's tea</a>\" from the UK. This bud heavy whole leaf Yunnan sun dried tea was mercilessly crammed into bamboo and hand roasted over an open flame.<br><br>The result is a shard heavy tea with many of broken bits and plenty of surface area which cause the tea to steep out very quickly making a very potent brew for an afternoon pick me up or a morning eye opener. This tea is very versatile with a heavy aroma of fragrant bamboo, malt and honey; not to mention a booming lingering aftertaste. Steep in gongfu style like a bamboo loving connoisseur or western style topped off with cream like you have a job to do.<br><br>The mash up of style and function makes this unique tea a common morning cup in the white2tea house.<br><br>Each piece of bamboo was pressed with 200 grams of tea.<br>"

The young tea still has a touch of astringency, with the sweet character and aroma of the tea peaking through the fragrances of the bamboo and the flame. A thick bodied and heavy tea when pushed, lighter amounts of tea can also be brewed for a refreshing, fragrant cup of tea. Suitable for aging or drinking now as your prefer.<br><br>Each full piece is roughly 200 grams of tea, with samples available.<br>"

In this case, the term <em>maocha</em> refers to the Dancong oolong tea being left in its raw form before pressing. We commissioned this production to be left with stems and large leaves for this pressing. The roast is also medium-heavy, roasted for 24 hours with the highest temperature at 125 C. We wanted a heavier roast that could evolve and calm in the coming years, despite having a slight bite at the time of pressing.<br><br>The brick is incredibly fragrant, with deeper honey and floral flavors emerging throughout the course of a session. This tea is still slightly punchy, but the tea has a complex interplay between the roast and the brighter aspects of a traditional Milan Dancong. Drink now or age as you please.<br><br>Each brick is 200 grams. Each tong is a bamboo leaf packed with two bricks.<br>Pressed in 2018 using Milan Dancong <em>maocha</em> [in this case, referring to the unsorted tea directly after processing. This tea includes stems and larger leaves].  Each brick is 200g. Bricks are packed in bamboo leaves, with two bricks in a tong."

This is what they signed up for and you've got bigger fish to fry. The crew continues sewing the sails as you plot the next move. Your throat is raw from barking orders.

The tea has light flavor and fragrance, causing it to be deceptively soft. Though we prefer to shy away from descriptions of body feeling, but it is worth mentioning that this tea creates an noticeable body feeling after being consumed. We do not recommend this tea for Puer beginners, as the subtlety and elegance of this tea may be lost on the beginners. <a href=\"http://localhost:8888/w2t/tea-shop/2015-little-walk/\" target=\"_blank\">This tea may be a better place to begin.</a><br>Bosch, pressed in 2015 by stone.  200g cakes, with 5 cakes in a bamboo tong."

Each tea brick is roughly 200 grams of tea of unknown origin. The exact age is just an estimation. This is not a zhongcha official production.
