Punchy when pushed, meaty thickness and plenty of room to mature, the bitter currents give way to a sweet wake that sticks in the mouth and throat. Each cake is 200 grams.Pressed in 2021. Each cake is 200g. The cakes are wrapped in bamboo leaf tongs, with five cakes per tong."

Whether or not those descriptions will fit your experience or not is anybody's guess. It is wildly difficult to pin this tea down and place into a box. Experience it for yourself.\n Each cake is 200g. Cakes are packaged in tongs of five cakes."

    "description": "Anhua heicha fu zhuan, or fu brick, is a post fermented tea from Hunan province in China that contains \"golden flowers\" [eurotium cristatum].\nAfter we fell in love with our 2018 sun fu, we commissioned a 2021 production from the very same producer.\nA wonderful, well rounded fu brick. Thick and rich with plenty of feeling, but without being too overwhelming for the daily cup. Sweet and aromatic daily fu that can be aged further or drank right away. \nEach brick is ~1000g of pressed tea.\nDisclaimer: We've heard that people suffering from gluten allergies may be sensitive to Fu zhuan / eurotium cristatum. Best to avoid this tea if you are sensitive or have Celiac disease"

Raw may be a misnomer, but calling it green doesn’t quite seem right either, and some folk have even suggested this tea qualify as a yellow tea or some hybrid unfermented heicha. In China people often call it nongjia or farmer style, though it is rarely sold on the open market due to small production sizes and lack of proper accreditation. You will find similarities in this tea that spans genres – green tea, yellow tea, heicha, raw Puer – there is a reason you can’t pin it down easily. \nLively aromas with a sticky sweetness and refreshing taste. Lovely to drink now or age as you desire.\nEach basket contains ~250g of tea."

Burly, full bodied, deep returning sweetness, layered nuance and heavy feel.\nObviously this tea is a natural fit for cigar lovers and Scotch whisky fanatics who want tea in the morning, but this tea is a surprise that will likely garner even fans who are wary of smoke.\nEach cake is 200 grams.Pressed in 2020. Each cake is 200g. The cakes are wrapped in bamboo leaf tongs, with five cakes per tong.\nFor aging, we recommend that smoked teas be sealed and separated from other teas, as the fresh smoke will pass along to the teas next to it.

A unique treat for heicha lovers.\nMade to age, but enjoyable straight away. \nBaskets contain ~250g of loosely pressed tea."

This bud heavy whole leaf Yunnan sun dried tea was mercilessly crammed into bamboo and hand roasted over an open flame.The result is a shard heavy tea with many of broken bits and plenty of surface area which cause the tea to steep out very quickly making a very potent brew for an afternoon pick me up or a morning eye opener. This tea is very versatile with a heavy aroma of fragrant bamboo, malt and honey; not to mention a booming lingering aftertaste. Steep in gongfu style like a bamboo loving connoisseur or western style topped off with cream like you have a job to do.The mash up of style and function makes this unique tea a common morning cup in the white2tea house.Each piece of bamboo was pressed with 200 grams of tea."

This just missed the release with our other 2020 Spring teas, so we are releasing it later than usual. \nThis tea is more of a personal production; a few kilograms of scraped together astronomically priced Yiwu. I wouldn't really recommend this tea for people who are new to drinking raw Puer. (under several years or so) The reasons this tea is phenomenal are not \"slap in the face obvious\", but it is unbelievably comforting to drink, like sweet silk covering your throat and stomach. Drink this tea if you are deep into Yiwu and have the budget, otherwise pretend you never saw this and buy the 2020 inb4 instead. It is a much better value and also a very high end Yiwu raw Puer.Each cake is 200 grams."

Even fewer people yet bother taking high end raw Puer and fermenting at very light levels which are riskier and more difficult to control. Even fewer people than that make multiple small batches of high end, deftly fermented materials and then blend them together.\nLucky for you, we are not most people. \nThe Nameless One blends several high end materials from several regions at several different levels of fermentation. The result is syrupy thickness, mouth watering huigan, and a complex and engaging steep to steep experience that will make you question the genre. This tea was blended to age, but it's entrancing now. \nThis is the culmination of five years of intense observation of the pile fermenting process in Menghai. If you're a fan of our teas, do not skip this. I'd recommend a tong for ten years from now.\nEach cake is 200 grams of tea."

The 2020 Conversation Pt.2 is the same material, but sun dried.Natural processing of very high quality material which have yielded an entrancing white tea with complex flavor and aroma.

This material is usually made into raw Puer, but this spring we commissioned productions of both sun dried white and sun dried black tea. The 2020 Mall Ninja Dojo and 2020 Horse Girl Clique are two teas made from identical material, but processed in two different ways.\nThe 2020 Mall Ninja Dojo is bright and aromatic with heavy full bodied character and even some residual astringency that signifies the character of the strength Menghai material. Floral and honey-like in its flavors and aromas, it's quite a unique white tea experience.\n Pressed in 2020, Each cake is 200g. A tong is a stack of five cakes."

    "description": "This tea is more of a personal production; a few kilograms of scraped together astronomically priced Yiwu. I wouldn't really recommend this tea for people who are new to drinking raw Puer. (under several years or so) The reasons this tea is phenomenal are not \"slap in the face obvious\", but it is unbelievably comforting to drink, like sweet silk covering your throat and stomach. Drink this tea if you are deep into Yiwu and have the budget, otherwise pretend you never saw this and buy the 2019 inb4 instead. It is a much better value and also a very high end Yiwu raw Puer.Each cake is 200 grams."

    "description": "The 2019 Milan Maocha is a bit of a misnomer, how can a tea be both maocha [loose tea] and a brick? In this case, the term maocha refers to the Dancong oolong tea being left in its raw form before pressing. We commissioned this production to be left with stems and large leaves for this pressing. The roast is medium-heavy, roasted for 24 hours with the highest temperature at 125 C. The heavier roast will evolve and calm in the coming years, despite having a slight bite at the time of pressing.The brick is incredibly fragrant, with deeper honey and floral flavors emerging throughout the course of a session. This tea is still slightly punchy, but the tea has a complex interplay between the roast and the brighter aspects of a traditional Milan Dancong. Excellent endurance, this tea can be re-steeped for a very long time. Drink now or age as you please.Each brick is 200 grams. Each tong is a bamboo leaf packed with two bricks.Pressed in 2019 using Milan Dancong maocha [in this case, referring to the unsorted tea directly after processing. This tea includes stems and larger leaves].  Each brick is 200g. Bricks are packed in bamboo leaves, with two bricks in a tong."

This production was made entirely of old arbor tea that is usually destined to be raw Puer tea. If you are accustomed to drinking yueguangbai teas with a bud heavy picking standard, you may notice that this tea has a lot of larger leaves; this is because when you make an old arbor tea you want to pick whatever the trees are giving and not waste a bit. The 2019 Conversation Pt.2 is the same material, but sun dried.The first white tea production this farmer has ever made. Natural processing of very high quality material which have yielded an entrancing white tea with complex flavor and aroma. Sweet, supple and a joy to drink.Each cake is 200 grams."

The tea has excellent endurance and can steep for a very long time and can even withstand being simmered or boiled without becoming acrid.Both the white tea and black tea have been sun dried and should age well together. However, we are only two three years deep on this experiment; though the results are promising, how it will age in the long term is anybody's guess. Hot Brandy is a mix of both white tea and black tea. 200g cake pressed in 2019. Each bamboo tong contains 5 cakes."

It is our white2tea twist on the classic concept strong style of \"builder's tea\" from the UK. This bud heavy whole leaf Yunnan sun dried tea was mercilessly crammed into bamboo and hand roasted over an open flame.The result is a shard heavy tea with many of broken bits and plenty of surface area which cause the tea to steep out very quickly making a very potent brew for an afternoon pick me up or a morning eye opener. This tea is very versatile with a heavy aroma of fragrant bamboo, malt and honey; not to mention a booming lingering aftertaste. Steep in gongfu style like a bamboo loving connoisseur or western style topped off with cream like you have a job to do.The mash up of style and function makes this unique tea a common morning cup in the white2tea house.Each piece of bamboo was pressed with 200 grams of tea."

    "description": "Anhua heicha fu zhuan, or fu brick, is a post fermented tea from Hunan province in China that contains \"golden flowers\" (eurotium cristatum).\nNot your average fu brick. After sampling endlessly throughout Anhua, the final victor among the legions of fu bricks vying for a coveted spot in the curated white2tea lineup.\nBeautiful tea all around. Thick and rich with plenty of feeling, but without being too overwhelming for the daily cup. Sweet and aromatic daily fu that screams its value with every steep. Can not express how quickly you will tear through a kilogram brick. \nEach brick is ~1000g of pressed tea.\nDisclaimer: We've heard that people suffering from gluten allergies may be sensitive to Fu zhuan / eurotium cristatum. Best to avoid this tea if you are sensitive or have Celiac disease"

    "description": "The 2018 Milan Maocha is a bit of a misnomer, how can a tea be both maocha [loose tea] and a brick? In this case, the term maocha refers to the Dancong oolong tea being left in its raw form before pressing. We commissioned this production to be left with stems and large leaves for this pressing. The roast is also medium-heavy, roasted for 24 hours with the highest temperature at 125 C. We wanted a heavier roast that could evolve and calm in the coming years, despite having a slight bite at the time of pressing.The brick is incredibly fragrant, with deeper honey and floral flavors emerging throughout the course of a session. This tea is still slightly punchy, but the tea has a complex interplay between the roast and the brighter aspects of a traditional Milan Dancong. Drink now or age as you please.Each brick is 200 grams. Each tong is a bamboo leaf packed with two bricks.Pressed in 2018 using Milan Dancong maocha [in this case, referring to the unsorted tea directly after processing. This tea includes stems and larger leaves].  Each brick is 200g. Bricks are packed in bamboo leaves, with two bricks in a tong."

Lily-livered bastards.  Is it the weeks of subsisting on mussels and whale meat? Straw mat beds and the churning waters that ceaselessly toy with our vessel? No matter. This is what they signed up for and you've got bigger fish to fry. The crew continues sewing the sails as you plot the next move. Your throat is raw from barking orders. The briny sea air and your pipe tobacco haven't helped a bit.Your first mate pokes his head through the door, \"Your tea is ready, Captain.\"Each mini cake is 8 grams, each purchase is for one mini cake.Roughly 8 gram mini cakes of raw Puer tea.You still want tasting notes? Is that why you're down here?Not cool, cap'n.This is a harsh, bully of a tea. Smoke &amp; pipe tobacco, with an aggressive, punchy power that leaves a wake of sweetness. A burly, heavy hitter. Will definitely benefit from aging, but if you're into the style, drinking it now is no mistake."

    "description": "This blend of ripe Puer was pressed with aged orange peels, also called chenpi from Xinhui, in Guangdong province. The orange peels add an entrancing fragrance to the tea and will age with the tea over time. When steeping, the tea opens first with a smooth soup texture, with the orange peels contributing more during mid to late steeps. The dynamic between the tea and the chenpi is engaging and soothing. An excellent drink for cold weather, nothing warms you up quite like a Big O.Each cake is 200 grams. The blend contains both ripe Puer tea and aged chenpi."

    "description": "Free Shipping anywhere on Earth, coupon code: basicsThe Sister Brother set is a comparison sample set that illustrates the difference in processing styles that can exist between two different people, in this case a sister and brother.The material in the bricks is identical Nannuo mountain material, but each brick was commissioned to be processed by only one person. The sister brick is material processed with a shorter kill green phase at a lower temperature, where as the brother brick is processed with a higher flame and fried for a longer time. These are their natural processing styles as people, I simply told them to process the tea as they normally would and to keep their respective materials separate for pressing.This set is best used in a side by side comparison to see how the person processing a tea can influence the end results of identical material. It should shed light on how much variation can truly occur, not only within a \"single origin\" tea, but even within a family using identical material from a single tea garden.Each set is 200 grams of raw Puer tea, comprised of two 100g bricks. Though this is an educational set, the tea is pretty damn nice - learning should be fun.The Sister Brother set includes two separate 100g Raw Puer bricks pressed in 2016. Each set totals 200g of tea."

The 2016 Censers has a complex fragrance that endures throughout a long session, lingering in the mouth and the cups long after the tea has gone. The fragrances and flavors shift between dark stone fruits and herbal medicines from steep to steep. This tea has a remarkably different character depending on brewing parameters. Lighter weight and fast steep times emphasize the sweetness, whereas a heavy hand brings out the thick bodied dark flavors.\n\n\n\nEach cake is 200g.\n\n\n\n\nThe dates on the original boxes was actually 2013, but the producer said to the best of his recollection it was in fact from spring 2016, so we went with the later date. The true age is anybody's guess, but it was pressed with age on it.\n"

    "description": "This 100 gram brick was uncovered in the depths of a puer warehouse, stacked tall, with no wrappers and nobody to claim it as a champion. When we first drank this tea, we knew we had found the bargain of our dreams. Plenty of body, but aged enough that it has a smooth and inviting character.The White Whale can easily go toe-to-toe with similar factory productions from the 2002 era, but the whale weighs in at a fraction of the cost. Those in search of a smooth daily puer tea with over a decade of age that doesn't hurt the wallet need search no further. 100 gram bricks. Previously unwrapped, the tea is tightly compressed and was stored in dry storage between Yunnan and South China since 2002."
