We then had them piled in individual small batches in 2017 using a technique where small batches of ripe Puer are fermented in bamboo baskets, off of the ground, using water from a mountain spring nearby Menghai. We were hands on during this entire process from start to finish and opted for a small batch pile process in order to ensure the integrity of the base material.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese teas were removed from the piling process in late 2017. Each tea was in the pile an average of 35 days.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough this is meant to be an educational set, the ripe Puer used in each cake is very high quality, making it appropriate for both beginners and experienced drinkers alike.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http:\/\/white2tea.com\/2014\/06\/13\/make-puerh-tea-gong-fu-style\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eFor brewing instructions, we recommend reading this article\u003c\/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eThe Tea Terroir Ripe Puer Tea Sample Set is a tool for learning about ripe Puer tea with 100 gram cakes of single origin, small batch ripe Puer tea.
