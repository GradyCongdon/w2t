{"product_id":"black-dawn-oolong","title":"Black Dawn Oolong","description":"\u003cp\u003eThe name of this tea is a direct translation of the varietal called \u003cem\u003ehei dan\u003c\/em\u003e (黑旦). A branch off of the \u003cem\u003ehuang jin gui\u003c\/em\u003e varietal from Luoyan, some local people also call it \u003cem\u003ehei jin gui\u003c\/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack Dawn has a unique fragrance of floral honey combined with the roasted character that drives the tea. The \u003cem\u003ehei dan\u003c\/em\u003e varietal is rarely grown and sold in Fujian, as several other varietals dominate the market landscape and there isn't much demand for it.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bad news is that this makes it slightly difficult to find with so few people growing and processing it. The good news is that it is remarkably inexpensive and an excellent value because its doesn't have the fame to command the price tag it deserves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe recommend a bag of Black Dawn if you need a \"no idea what to drink\" oolong tea that you can grab and steep without fear of hurting your bank account.\u003c\/p\u003e\nEach purchase is for 50 grams.\u003cbr\u003e","brand":"white2tea","offers":[{"title":"50g","offer_id":39349345910975,"sku":"32019A","price":6.5,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0313\/6064\/7305\/products\/BlackDawnOolong.jpg?v=1615647036","url":"https:\/\/white2tea.com\/products\/black-dawn-oolong","provider":"white2tea","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
