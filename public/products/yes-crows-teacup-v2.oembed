{"product_id":"yes-crows-teacup-v2","title":"Yes Crows Teacup V2","description":"The Yes Crows V2 teacup was designed and commissioned by white2tea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach piece is Jingdezhen porcelain, handmade and hand painted for white2tea. The pictures accurately represent the overall design of the teacup, however, as one would expect with a fully handmade and hand painted teacup depicting a murder of chaotic birds, there will be slight variations from cup to cup, such as image, text spacing, color and clarity.
