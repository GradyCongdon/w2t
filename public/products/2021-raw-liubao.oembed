We did not have enough left for baskets, but had a little loose tea left for our new heicha section.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot the typical mass produced and pile fermented dark liubao. Raw may be a misnomer, but calling it green doesn’t quite seem right either, and some folk have even suggested this tea qualify as a yellow tea or some hybrid unfermented heicha. In China people often call it \u003cem\u003enongjia\u003c\/em\u003e or farmer style, though it is rarely sold on the open market due to small production sizes and lack of proper accreditation. You will find similarities in this tea that spans genres – green tea, yellow tea, heicha, raw Puer – there is a reason you can’t pin it down easily. \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBright aromas and sweetness with a hefty \u003cem\u003e﻿huigan\u003c\/em\u003e﻿ (returning sweetness) that is sticky and refreshing.
