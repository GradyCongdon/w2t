{"product_id":"2016-last-thoughts","title":"2016 Last Thoughts","description":"A blend of raw Puer material from Yiwu region. When we first made this blend in 2014, we wrote \"This tier of tea rarely sees the light of day in the open market,\" and we sincerely mean that. Not a blend we would recommend for beginners. The traits that make this tea special are often not apparent to most new Puer drinkers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will not be making this exact blend next year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach cake is 357 grams. The per gram price and cake price of this tea are identical to facilitate people buying less than a full cake with no mark up.","brand":"white2tea","offers":[{"title":"357g","offer_id":31961879478409,"sku":"21611A","price":568.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"25g","offer_id":31961879543945,"sku":"21611B","price":40.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0313\/6064\/7305\/products\/2016-LastThoughts-Tea.jpg?v=1581314759","url":"https:\/\/white2tea.com\/products\/2016-last-thoughts","provider":"white2tea","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
