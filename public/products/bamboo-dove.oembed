The base material is identical to our \u003ca href=\"http:\/\/white2tea.com\/product\/2017-turtle-dove\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e2017 Turtle Dove\u003c\/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe aromatics of the bamboo and the roast of the fire have engulfed with the white tea to make a very unique tea. It has a complex character of sweetness and smoothness, melded with the heavy nature of being roasted on an open flame.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tea will benefit from a few months of rest, as it was processed in late October of 2017, and as of the release the taste of the roast is still quite fresh. Drink now or aged as desired.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe decided to produce this tea according to the natural shapes of the bamboo rather than waste pieces that didnâ€™t fit our ideal shape or size. We will break apart the amount you choose and send it in a sealed bag. If you would like an entire piece with the bamboo, please contact us directly and we will help you choose a size. Most are around 400 grams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach purchase is for 50 grams.\u003cbr\u003e","brand":"white2tea","offers":[{"title":"50g","offer_id":32386962653321,"sku":"41705","price":9.5,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0313\/6064\/7305\/products\/2017-bamboo-dove-white-tea-1.jpg?v=1580937335","url":"https:\/\/white2tea.com\/products\/bamboo-dove","provider":"white2tea","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
