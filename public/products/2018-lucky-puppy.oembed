{"product_id":"2018-lucky-puppy","title":"2018 Lucky Puppy","description":"The most complex blend of 2018, involving a wide range of high end material from several regions. The unique character of this tea is heavy with strength. Lucky Puppy evolves from steep to steep in a gongfu brewing session, displaying a wide array of characteristics and a unique experience. The tea has a powerful aggressive character in earlier steeps, with a lasting huigan and depth of returning flavor. The later steeps trail off into smooth sweetness and can be resteeped many times. Drink now or age if you can keep your hands off this puppy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach cake is 200 grams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e","brand":"white2tea","offers":[{"title":"200g","offer_id":31961894617225,"sku":"21804A","price":268.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"25g","offer_id":31961894649993,"sku":"21804B","price":38.5,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0313\/6064\/7305\/products\/2018-Lucky-Puppy-Puer-Tea.jpg?v=1580922493","url":"https:\/\/white2tea.com\/products\/2018-lucky-puppy","provider":"white2tea","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
