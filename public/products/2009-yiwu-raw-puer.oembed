{"product_id":"2009-yiwu-raw-puer","title":"2009 Yiwu Raw Puer","description":"This Yiwu tea is made from 2009 Yiwu material, pressed and then stored in Guangzhou natural conditions soon after pressing. It is just nearing middle aged character, with a lingering sweetness and strong presence. The tea is already fairly smooth for those who prefer to enjoy it now, but would also benefit from long term aging.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe wrapper says \"Yiwu Gushu\" [old arbor tea] among other claims, all of which should be taken with a grain of salt. (Actual Yiwu Gushu would add a zero to this price) However, the tea is a very well priced quality tea for those looking to drink middle aged Yiwu or seeking to build a collection. A tong of this tea is quite affordable to put away for the years to come.\u003cbr\u003eThis \u003cem\u003eYiwu\u003c\/em\u003e raw puer tea cake is 357 grams and is made of material from 2009. It was stored in dry\/natural conditions in Guangzhou since 2010. Tongs are 7 cakes and wrapped in bamboo.","brand":"white2tea","offers":[{"title":"357g","offer_id":31961878003849,"sku":"20901A","price":92.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"25g","offer_id":31961877971081,"sku":"20901B","price":7.75,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0313\/6064\/7305\/products\/2009_Yiwu_NaturalGZ_1_901d4347-da4d-4724-8f54-0b64b4e0b6fa.jpg?v=1584008637","url":"https:\/\/white2tea.com\/products\/2009-yiwu-raw-puer","provider":"white2tea","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
