Our Puer all blended in Yunnan, we shipped the blends to Fujian in summer. A veteran Lapsang smoker spent 3 days smoking our tea, smoking at temperatures from 100C to 120C in an old style Lapsang smokehouse in Tongmuguan village.\u003cbr data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eThe unity of old school Fujian tea processing techniques with high quality base materials yields a totally unique smoke experience that pushes the tradition of smoked Puer tea in Yunnan (both the intentional and haphazard unintentional versions).\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eThe pine smoke character is laced through the blend with an intense nose that will settle into the base of the tea with aging, eventually transforming into a rare combination of flavors and aromas that few Puer teas can mimic.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eObviously this tea is a natural fit for cigar lovers and Scotch whisky fanatics who want tea in the morning, but this tea is a surprise that will likely garner even fans who are wary of smoke.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmokeshou is a blend of our own small batch shou Puer. A thick bodied tea with layers of bitterness and smoke over the rich and velvety shou mouthfeel. Perfect tea for cold weather or a rainy day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach purchase is for one 7 gram mini.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFor aging, we recommend that smoked teas be sealed and separated from other teas, as the fresh smoke will pass along to the teas next to it. Or you can keep them with your cigars.\u003c\/em\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"white2tea","offers":[{"title":"7g","offer_id":40849653661887,"sku":"12114A","price":3.2,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0313\/6064\/7305\/products\/2021-Smoke-shou-mini-Dragon-Ball-Tea.jpg?v=1633761422","url":"https:\/\/white2tea.com\/products\/2021-smokeshou-mini","provider":"white2tea","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
