{"product_id":"white-milan","title":"White Milan","description":"This early spring 2019 white tea is made in a sun dried white style. The tea has minimal processing, picked and sun dried. This tea was processed from tea that is usually destined to be made as Dancong oolong, made from the Milan varietal from Guangdong province.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Milan White is sweet and succulent. The large leaves take several steeps to ramp up, pouring out a bright spectrum of fragrances during a gongfu session. Quite a unique experience, as this varietal of tea is seldom produced as white tea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach purchase is for 25 grams.\u003cbr\u003e","brand":"white2tea","offers":[{"title":"25g","offer_id":32386968486025,"sku":"41901","price":7.5,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0313\/6064\/7305\/products\/Milan-white-Dancong-Whitetea.jpg?v=1580893011","url":"https:\/\/white2tea.com\/products\/white-milan","provider":"white2tea","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
