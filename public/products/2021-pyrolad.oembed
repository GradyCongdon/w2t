Our Puer all blended in Yunnan, we shipped the blends to Fujian in summer. A veteran Lapsang smoker spent 3 days smoking our tea, smoking at temperatures from 100C to 120C in an old style Lapsang smokehouse in Tongmuguan village.\u003cbr data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eThe unity of old school Fujian tea processing techniques with high quality base materials yields a totally unique smoke experience that pushes the tradition of smoked Puer tea in Yunnan (both the intentional and haphazard unintentional versions).\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eThe pine smoke character is laced through the blend with an intense nose that will settle into the base of the tea with aging, eventually transforming into a rare combination of flavors and aromas that few Puer teas can mimic.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eAs for the tea blend, you can imagine that we wouldn't phone-in a blend that requires so much planning and legwork to process, suffice it to say it's fantastic. Burly, full bodied, deep returning sweetness, layered nuance and heavy feel.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously this tea is a natural fit for cigar lovers and Scotch whisky fanatics who want tea in the morning, but this tea is a surprise that will likely garner even fans who are wary of smoke.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach cake is 200 grams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePressed in 2020.
