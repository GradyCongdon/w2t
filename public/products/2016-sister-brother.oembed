The sister brick is material processed with \u003ca href=\"http:\/\/white2tea.com\/2014\/05\/08\/how-is-puer-tea-made\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ea shorter kill green phase\u003c\/a\u003e at a lower temperature, where as the brother brick is processed with a higher flame and fried for a longer time. These are their natural processing styles as people, I simply told them to process the tea as they normally would and to keep their respective materials separate for pressing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis set is best used in a side by side comparison to see how the person processing a tea can influence the end results of identical material. It should shed light on how much variation can truly occur, not only within a \"single origin\" tea, but even within a family using identical material from a single tea garden.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach set is 200 grams of raw Puer tea, comprised of two 100g bricks. Though this is an educational set, the tea is pretty damn nice - learning should be fun.\u003cbr\u003eThe Sister Brother set includes two separate 100g Raw Puer bricks pressed in 2016. Each set totals 200g of tea.","brand":"white2tea","offers":[{"title":"200g","offer_id":31961881510025,"sku":"21621","price":49.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0313\/6064\/7305\/products\/2016-Sister-Brother-sampleset-tea-b.jpg?v=1580909892","url":"https:\/\/white2tea.com\/products\/2016-sister-brother","provider":"white2tea","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
