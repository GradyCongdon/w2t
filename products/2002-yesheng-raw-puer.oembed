An excellent example of clean dry stored Guangzhou Puer. This tea is ready to drink now as an aged tea, or could be aged further as you see fit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach cake is roughly 357 grams with samples available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*As with any tea, we think it is best to sample and make sure you like the tea based on the qualities it offers rather than the numerical age or pedigree\u003cbr\u003e357 gram cake of 2002 yesheng raw Puer stored in Guangzhou clean dry storage.","brand":"white2tea","offers":[{"title":"357g","offer_id":31961897500809,"sku":"20204A","price":235.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"25g","offer_id":31961897468041,"sku":"20204B","price":19.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0313\/6064\/7305\/products\/2002-Fuhai-raw-Puer-tea.jpg?v=1596018339","url":"https:\/\/white2tea.com\/products\/2002-yesheng-raw-puer","provider":"white2tea","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
