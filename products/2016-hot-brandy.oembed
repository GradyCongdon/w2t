{"product_id":"2016-hot-brandy","title":"2016 Hot Brandy","description":"A blend of both white and black tea, Hot Brandy is a completely new style of cake that was born of experimentation. The soup is thick, smooth, and fragrant. It fairs well with both gongfu style and western style brewing. The tea has excellent endurance and can steep for a very long time and can even withstand being simmered or boiled without becoming acrid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth the white tea and black tea have been sun dried and should age well together. However, this cake is the first of its kind; how it will age is anybody's guess.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eHot Brandy is a mix of both white tea and black tea. 200g cake pressed in 2016.
