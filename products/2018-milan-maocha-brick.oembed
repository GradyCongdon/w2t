{"product_id":"2018-milan-maocha-brick","title":"2018 Milan Maocha Brick","description":"The 2018 Milan Maocha is a bit of a misnomer, how can a tea be both \u003cem\u003emaocha\u003c\/em\u003e [loose tea] and a brick? In this case, the term \u003cem\u003emaocha\u003c\/em\u003e refers to the Dancong oolong tea being left in its raw form before pressing. We commissioned this production to be left with stems and large leaves for this pressing. The roast is also medium-heavy, roasted for 24 hours with the highest temperature at 125 C. We wanted a heavier roast that could evolve and calm in the coming years, despite having a slight bite at the time of pressing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe brick is incredibly fragrant, with deeper honey and floral flavors emerging throughout the course of a session. This tea is still slightly punchy, but the tea has a complex interplay between the roast and the brighter aspects of a traditional Milan Dancong. Drink now or age as you please.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach brick is 200 grams. Each tong is a bamboo leaf packed with two bricks.\u003cbr\u003ePressed in 2018 using Milan Dancong \u003cem\u003emaocha\u003c\/em\u003e [in this case, referring to the unsorted tea directly after processing. This tea includes stems and larger leaves].  Each brick is 200g. Bricks are packed in bamboo leaves, with two bricks in a tong.","brand":"white2tea","offers":[{"title":"200g","offer_id":31961895960713,"sku":"31806A","price":65.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"25g","offer_id":31961895993481,"sku":"31806B","price":9.8,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0313\/6064\/7305\/products\/2018-Milan-Maocha-Brick-Dancong-Ooolong-7.jpg?v=1580923159","url":"https:\/\/white2tea.com\/products\/2018-milan-maocha-brick","provider":"white2tea","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
