The aromatics of the bamboo and the touch of the open flame are integrated with the white tea in a beautiful way. It has a complex character of sweetness and smoothness, melded with the heavy nature of the roast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs with many bamboo teas, the processing tends to break the leaves a bit, leading to a more intense brew than usual. You might enjoy it better by knocking down your usual brew weight by a gram or two - or fly away on dove wings, if you prefer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach purchase is for 200 grams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"white2tea","offers":[{"title":"200g","offer_id":39349962047679,"sku":"42017A","price":35.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"25g","offer_id":39349965062335,"sku":"42017B","price":5.5,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0313\/6064\/7305\/products\/2020-Hand-roasted-bamboo-tea-Bamboo-Dove.jpg?v=1615471795","url":"https:\/\/white2tea.com\/products\/2020-bamboo-dove","provider":"white2tea","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
