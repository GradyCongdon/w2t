{"product_id":"stone-milk","title":"Stone Milk","description":"Stone Milk is an oolong tea from the Fujian province of China.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe name \u003cem\u003eshiru\u003c\/em\u003e literally translates as Stone Milk and is a lesser known variety of \u003cem\u003eyancha\u003c\/em\u003e [rock oolong]. We find the Stone Milk to be one of the best balances of value and quality in our yancha lineup. Stone Milk has a robust roast and a creamy fragrance and flavor. The body of the tea is thick and has a mineral character that plays well with the aromas of the tea. Definitely worth trying for both beginners and experienced yancha drinkers alike.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach purchase is for 25 grams of tea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e","brand":"white2tea","offers":[{"title":"25g","offer_id":32386785902729,"sku":"31908A","price":14.5,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0313\/6064\/7305\/products\/Stone-Milk-Shiru-Oolong.jpg?v=1580891256","url":"https:\/\/white2tea.com\/products\/stone-milk","provider":"white2tea","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
