The tea has light flavor and fragrance, causing it to be deceptively soft. Though we prefer to shy away from descriptions of body feeling, but it is worth mentioning that this tea creates an noticeable body feeling after being consumed. We do not recommend this tea for Puer beginners, as the subtlety and elegance of this tea may be lost on the beginners. \u003ca href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/w2t\/tea-shop\/2015-little-walk\/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThis tea may be a better place to begin.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBosch, pressed in 2015 by stone.  200g cakes, with 5 cakes in a bamboo tong.","brand":"white2tea","offers":[{"title":"200g","offer_id":31961870860425,"sku":"15W2TBSRWPR","price":119.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"25g Sample","offer_id":31961870893193,"sku":"15W2TBSRWPR","price":16.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0313\/6064\/7305\/products\/Bosch_1.jpg?v=1580900592","url":"https:\/\/white2tea.com\/products\/2015-bosch","provider":"white2tea","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
