The 2016 Censers has a complex fragrance that endures throughout a long session, lingering in the mouth and the cups long after the tea has gone. The fragrances and flavors shift between dark stone fruits and herbal medicines from steep to steep. This tea has a remarkably different character depending on brewing parameters. Lighter weight and fast steep times emphasize the sweetness, whereas a heavy hand brings out the thick bodied dark flavors.\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eEach cake is 200g.\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch6\u003eThe dates on the original boxes was actually 2013, but the producer said to the best of his recollection it was in fact from spring 2016, so we went with the later date.
