  "description": "An aged shou Puer tea with clean south China storage perfect for a daily cup. A lovely soup that looks likes an aged red wine with woody character over a layer of subtle sweetness. A little too easy to drink, if you ask me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach cake is 357g.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe true date of this tea is unknown, though mid-2000's is our best guess. This inner ticket is also unknown to us, but a bit of research shows that this company was disbanded for reasons of fraudulent activity in the mid 2010's.Â  If you're looking for a tea with a clear origin, this ain't it. If you'd like a nice shou Puer to drink that has settled into middle age, it's an excellent choice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e",
