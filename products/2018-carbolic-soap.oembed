{"product_id":"2018-carbolic-soap","title":"2018 Carbolic Soap","description":"“Nobody needs to go anywhere else. We are all, if we only knew it, already there. If I only knew who in fact I am, I should cease to behave as what I think I am; and if I stopped behaving as what I think I am, I should know who I am. What in fact I am, if only the Manichee I think I am would allow me to know it, is the reconciliation of yes and no lived out in total acceptance and the blessed experience of Not-Two. In religion all words are dirty words. Anybody who gets eloquent about Buddha, or God, or Christ, ought to have his mouth washed out with carbolic soap.” - Aldous Huxley\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach cake is 200 grams.\u003cbr\u003eThe 2018 Carbolic Soap is a high quality Milan Dancong oolong that we really enjoyed and wanted to age for our own consumption.
