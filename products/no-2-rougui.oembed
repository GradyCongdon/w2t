From early May 2018, this tea had four roasts, but the flavors of the flame have receded by the time of its release to reveal the flavors and aromas of dark fruits and deep mineral character within the tea. Rather than give a play-by-play of the complexities that occur in this tea over the course of a gongfu session, we recommend trying this tea and experiencing it for yourself. One of our favorite yanchas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach purchase is for 25 grams of tea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e","brand":"white2tea","offers":[{"title":"25g","offer_id":32386767552649,"sku":"31909A","price":25.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0313\/6064\/7305\/products\/No2-Rougui-Yancha-Oolong.jpg?v=1580888596","url":"https:\/\/white2tea.com\/products\/no-2-rougui","provider":"white2tea","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
