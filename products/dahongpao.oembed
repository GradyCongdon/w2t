{"product_id":"dahongpao","title":"Dahongpao","description":"Our Dahongpao is a blend of oolong tea from the Fujian province of China.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginally used to describe the tea from a small group of bushes in Fujian, the name Dahongpao in a modern context is more commonly used to describe blends of \u003cem\u003eyancha\u003c\/em\u003e [rock oolong] instead of denoting a varietal or processing distinction. Our Dahongpao is a blend that relies heavily on the \u003cem\u003eMeizhan\u003c\/em\u003e varietal with traditional style processing that incorporates the roast, mineral nature and fragrances of typical yancha in a balanced way. Excellent as an introduction to quality yancha.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach purchase is for 25 grams of tea.\u003cbr\u003e","brand":"white2tea","offers":[{"title":"25g","offer_id":32386759000201,"sku":"31915","price":9.5,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0313\/6064\/7305\/products\/dahongpao-big-red-robe-oolong-1.jpg?v=1580940027","url":"https:\/\/white2tea.com\/products\/dahongpao","provider":"white2tea","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
