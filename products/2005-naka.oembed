{"product_id":"2005-naka","title":"2005 Naka","description":"Naka raw puer tea pressed April first of 2005. Stored in excellent humid, but not too humid conditions. The first couple of steeps retain some astringency. Depth of feeling in the throat and slick texture in the mouth. Our opinion is that this tea generates an uncommon body response of deep calm.","brand":"white2tea","offers":[{"title":"357g","offer_id":31961868107913,"sku":"20501A","price":449.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"25g","offer_id":31961868140681,"sku":"20501B","price":36.5,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0313\/6064\/7305\/products\/2005_Naka_11b.jpg?v=1584008635","url":"https:\/\/white2tea.com\/products\/2005-naka","provider":"white2tea","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
