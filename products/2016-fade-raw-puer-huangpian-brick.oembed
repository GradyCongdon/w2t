{"product_id":"2016-fade-raw-puer-huangpian-brick","title":"2016 Fade","description":"The Fade brick is a raw Puer tea, pressed in 2016 using 2015 Yiwu \u003cem\u003eHuangpian \u003c\/em\u003e[the largest leaf in Puer processing] material.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile huangpian are often considered to be inexpensive, the quality of the material in this blend is very high. The tea is sweet and thick. There is a slight sour note in the tea which will give way to honey and smoothness with further aging. We also feel this tea has a strong body feeling, though that varies from person to person.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSuitable to drink now or age for the long haul. There are 5 bricks per 1 kilogram tong.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e","brand":"white2tea","offers":[{"title":"200g","offer_id":31961878102153,"sku":"21615A","price":33.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"25g","offer_id":31961878134921,"sku":"21615B","price":5.25,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0313\/6064\/7305\/products\/2016-fade-brick-raw-puer-tea-1.jpg?v=1580907239","url":"https:\/\/white2tea.com\/products\/2016-fade-raw-puer-huangpian-brick","provider":"white2tea","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
