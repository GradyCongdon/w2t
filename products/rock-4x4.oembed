This blend has enduring aromas and a burly bite from both the flame and the strength of the tea. This blend is for seekers of strong tea; heavy handed roast and heavy handed character. The depth and character of the aromas and flavors shift from steep to steep, making for an interesting gongfu experience. If you are looking for a smooth and elegant tea, take a rain check on the 4x4.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach purchase is for 25 grams of tea.\u003cbr\u003e","brand":"white2tea","offers":[{"title":"25g","offer_id":32386771976329,"sku":"31914","price":14.5,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0313\/6064\/7305\/products\/Rock-4x4-yancha-oolong-1.jpg?v=1580889625","url":"https:\/\/white2tea.com\/products\/rock-4x4","provider":"white2tea","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
