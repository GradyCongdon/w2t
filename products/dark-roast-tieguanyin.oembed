{"product_id":"dark-roast-tieguanyin","title":"Dark Roast Tieguanyin","description":"Our dark roast Tieguanyin is an oolong tea from Fujian province that was roasted in a small batch. It is roasted along the fine line of allowing the character of the tea to express itself beneath a heavier roast style. The depth of aroma in the tea has a broad range of aroma from the rinsed leaf, to the flavor and through the residual fragrances of the cup; heavy roast coffee, tar, baked cinnamon apples, oak, seaweed, charred vegetables, toffee, dark chocolate, maple syrup, scotch, bourbon and gingerbread cookies. It is a tea with plenty going on for lovers of the complex, but it is also balanced enough to drink on regular basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach purchase is for 50g of tea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eEach package contains 50 grams of roasted Tieguanyin oolong tea from Fujian province.","brand":"white2tea","offers":[{"title":"50g","offer_id":32386760966281,"sku":"31808","price":14.5,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0313\/6064\/7305\/products\/Dark-Roast-Tieguanyin.jpg?v=1580940389","url":"https:\/\/white2tea.com\/products\/dark-roast-tieguanyin","provider":"white2tea","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
