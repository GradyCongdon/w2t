{"product_id":"2006-old-bear-fangcha-puer-brick","title":"2006 Old Bear Fangcha","description":"The Old Bear brick is a smokey, heavy tea that is ideal for tea drinkers who enjoy flavors that are present in Scotch whisky, cigars, and pipe tobacco.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Old Bear is a 100 gram brick that we found unpackaged in a warehouse. The tight compression of the traditional \u003cem\u003efangcha\u003c\/em\u003e [square brick] style served it well, as most pieces are wholly intact. The characteristic smoke of the fangcha has faded slightly, but still carries a punch in the early steeps. The tea is a burly daily drinker for tea drinkers who want some oomph in their cup.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: We have run out of Old Bear boxes! However, we still have some Old Bear left. It's identical tea, but will be shipped in a sealed white2tea bag instead.\u003cbr\u003e","brand":"white2tea","offers":[{"title":"100g","offer_id":31961870237833,"sku":"20601A","price":24.5,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0313\/6064\/7305\/products\/2006_Old_Bear_1.jpg?v=1580896322","url":"https:\/\/white2tea.com\/products\/2006-old-bear-fangcha-puer-brick","provider":"white2tea","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
